simplecli
==============

.. .. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/techniq/flask-script.png

A set of decorators, classes and helpers for writing your own script commands.

Useful for creating command-line scripts, cronjobs etc., e.g. outside a
web application.

simplecli is *heavily* based on the excellent Flask-Script, which only 
drawback is that it assumes that you are working in a Flask environment.
Simplecli mainly removes the dependency on Flask.  If you are indeed in
a Flask environment, I encourage you to try out Flask-Script instead.
