simplecli
=========

.. .. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/baeuml/simplecli.png

A set of decorators, classes and helpers for writing your own 
command line interfaces.

Useful for creating command-line scripts, cronjobs etc., e.g. outside a
web application.

simplecli is *heavily* based on the excellent 
`Flask-Script <http://packages.python.org/Flask-Script/>`, which only 
drawback is that it assumes that you are working in a Flask environment.
Simplecli mainly removes the dependency on Flask.  If you are indeed in
a Flask environment, I encourage you to try out Flask-Script instead.
